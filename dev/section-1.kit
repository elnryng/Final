        <p>Our mission is an important one. We seek to marry entertainment with education. This will be an event like no
            other. You are invited to join us November 3rd at the Philadelphia Insectarium. </p>

        <p class="hide-for-mobile">For less than the cost of admission, you and your guests can explore the entire
            museum. With every ticket purchased, we will make a donation to one of our featured charities on your
            behalf. We have a custom curated oddities flea market for you to find a treasure. Our entire second floor
            has been designated as our oddities ink tattoo parlour where you will be able to grab a custom flash piece
            by some of the industry's most talented artists. Downstairs, in our classroom, we will have some of the most
            affordably priced classes around. Be sure to book in advance. </p>

        <p class="hide-for-mobile">Periodically throughout the day, guest presenters will be doing free presentations
            and giveaways about some of the most fascinating topics in science today. Stay tuned for more info. We
            cannot wait to see you there!</p>
