Deirdre was tired of finding that so-called rescues and shelters were euthanizing healthy, friendly, and adoptable animals due to their alleged “breed,” and so she utilized her background in modeling and education in fine arts to create a calendar like no other–eye-catching pinup girls and their pups.</p>
                                            <p class="hide-for-mobile">PFPB is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to educate people about the history, temperament, and plight of the pit bull-type dog; raising awareness to rally against Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) and Breed Discriminatory Laws (BDL). PFPB’s goal is to restore the image of the pit bull-type dog to its former reputation of America’s companion animal, war hero, and family member.

Operation Monarch also coordinates several community milkweed planting projects and conducts research on how to optimize planting programs to help create pollinator habitats. Donations go towards supporting these educational programs.
